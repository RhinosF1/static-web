Greetings! I am iownall555.

I typically hang out in #linuxmasterrace and a bunch of other channels and have an interest in Linux, FOSS, gaming and programming (primarily Python and a bit of Perl, C and recently Kotlin).
Feel free to ask me for help in person if you need it or join #help if your query is specifically network related.

I have a website located [here](https://redquasar.xyz) that contains my programming projects among other things.
Furthermore as I use PGP my key can be found on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/iownall555) or on my website under the "About" section.
