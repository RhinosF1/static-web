Hello, I'm jotun, a software engineer living in sunny California.

I've been using IRC - and coding things for IRC - for nearly 20 years. You might've heard of my game, <a href="http://idlerpg.net/">Idle RPG</a>. If not, you can check it out in #idlerpg on Snoonet!

I discovered Snoonet about a year and a half ago and thought it'd be fun to work with a network that combined two of my favorite things - IRC and reddit. Since joining, I've had some really wild experiences and met some amazing new friends.

If you like to code, or are interested in learning to code, stop by #programming and say hello!
