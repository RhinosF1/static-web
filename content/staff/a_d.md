Ohai, I'm A_D, also sometimes known as Roy_Mustang or A_Dragon.

You can find me in a whole lot of channels, usually I'll be active in #casualconversation and #aspergers, but I do pop up elsewhere pretty often too, I'm always in #help and if I am around I will be pinged by any message in that channel.
In my free time I like to play games like Factorio, RimWorld and MineCraft, browse Reddit or sit around writing client scripts of varying complexity. I'm happy to be PMed at any time, you can do so with `/query A_D` or `/query Roy_Mustang` If you're not sure which, drop into #help and have a look at the user list, or better yet, ping me in #snoonet, A_D or Roy_Mustang will always ping me, no matter my nick. You can also e-mail me at A_D@snoonet.org

If you're not sure that you're talking to me, you can whois me, I will always have a staff vhost and will almost always be connected using a client certificate with the fingerprint `42E8 817B B764 0649 7E47 398B A9A0 A434`. you can check this in my whois;

`* [A_D] has client certificate fingerprint 42e8817bb76406497e47398ba9a0a434`

Otherwise, if you really need to verify its me, you can get me to PGP sign something. My public key is on keybase.io if you want to verify something I gave you, you can do so at [keybase.io/verify](https://keybase.io/verify), just paste the text into the block and hit the verify button.
