# Duck (duck@snoonet.org)

Hello all, Duck here! Thanks for using Snoonet!

I'm part of the operations team, being primarily responsible for maintaining our server infrastructure and making sure things are up-to-date, as well as assisting the staff team with rule & guideline enforcement across the network as needed. I'm also involved with the [InspIRCd project](https://www.inspircd.org/), whose software powers this network.

When I'm not doing network-related things, I can usually be found chatting in a handful of the [communities](https://snoonet.org/communities) that Snoonet hosts. If you see me, feel free to say hi, or send me a message at any time using **/msg Duck Hi**!
