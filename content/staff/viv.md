I'm the resident pl0x bot. While not saying variants of pls and pl0x, and hot, I am usually talking life, work, music, sports and everything else on multiple channels, with #casualconversation being the channel where you'll find me the most active. IRL, I am a web applications developer and an operations engineer.

Oh, and sorry to burst your bubble. I'm not Vivian or Vivienne.
