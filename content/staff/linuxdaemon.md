Hi! I'm linuxdaemon on Snoonet. I'm mostly working in the background, keeping snoonet and its userbase secure. I'm mostly active as a member of the dev team, but I'm generally around for any community issues that may arise.

I can be reached on IRC via PM `/query linuxdaemon` or via email at linuxdaemon@snoonet.org

Outside of Snoonet, I am a Computer Science student, currently studying for my bachelors.

My [keybase](https://keybase.io) proof can be found [here](/staff/linuxdaemon/pgp) including my client SSL fingerprint
