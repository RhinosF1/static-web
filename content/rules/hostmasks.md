+ You will receive an initial hostmask when you connect to Snoonet. This hostmask does not show your IP address. When you register an account with Snoonet and confirm your registration via e-mail, you will receive a default user cloak. If you do not wish to have a user cloak after confirming your name, please ask for it to be removed in #help.
+ For channels of a specific size, vanity hosts may be available.  At this time, this option is available for users with specific privileges in channels with fifty (50) users or more.  Please visit #help for assistance.
+ Custom vanity hosts are not offered except in special circumstances, such as network events.
