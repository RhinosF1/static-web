+ Available names may be freely registered with NickServ so long as they do not violate network policy.
+ There is a maximum of 5 grouped nicknames per account. Use [NickServ](https://snoonet.org/anope#NickServ)'s GROUP command as opposed to REGISTER.
+ Nickname squatting is not permitted. We ask that all registered or grouped names be put to use.
+ Users may request ownership of their chosen nickname on Snoonet, but this is offered as a privilege and not a right.  To request a specific nickname, please contact us in #help.  Requests will be considered and discussed at the sole discretion of Snoonet staff.  We may refuse to drop nicknames that violate Snoonet rules, are historically significant, are reserved for network purposes, or for any other reason.  Nicknames must be inactive for at least 3 months before requested to be dropped.
+ Your nickname may not contain any racial slurs or bigotry. Names in violation of this are subject to being dropped and/or prohibited, with repeat offenders being banned.
+ Temporary/disposable email addresses are prohibited. Snoonet reserves the right to delete your registration if you register with a false/throwaway email address.
+ By default, nicknames have an insane expiration date. Single accounts with 1 name and 6+ months of inactivity may be dropped if someone requests the name. Nicknames grouped to any single account may be ungrouped after 3+ months of inactivity and upon request of another user.
